#This project is used from code by Adash Menon >> https://github.com/adarsh1021/facedetection with some guidance on inline output printing from this ask forum >> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34643747/ipython-notebook-jupyter-opencv-cv2-and-plotting . Code used to do the linear regression was taken from >> https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.linregress.html .
